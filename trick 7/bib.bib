 abstract = {This paper studies estimators that make sample analogues of population orthogonality conditions close to zero. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of such estimators is established under the assumption that the observable variables are stationary and ergodic. Since many linear and nonlinear econometric estimators reside within the class of estimators studied in this paper, a convenient summary of the large sample properties of these estimators, including some whose large sample properties have not heretofore been discussed, is provided.},

abstract = {I present proofs for the consistency of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators presented in Hansen (1982). Some basic approximation results provide the groundwork for the analysis of a class of such estimators. Using these results, I establish the large sample convergence of GMM estimators under alternative restrictions on the estimation problem.}
